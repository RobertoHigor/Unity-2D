  storyText: 'Festers. Everywhere. Armed mostly with gas-powered rock flingers.


    At
    least 10 of them guarding the hangar door. Typical.

    Could try punching your
    way through. Or sneaking the long way to the emergency exit.


    What should
    you do?


    1. Take them head on - rush the 10 guards.

    2. Sneak your way
    to the emergency exit.'
